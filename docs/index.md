# Under Construction

This is the future home of the Programming by Stealth series, but for now, [bartb.ie/pbs](https://bartb.ie/pbs) remains the series home page.

# About

Programming by Stealth is an on-going collaborative project between [Bart Busschots](https://bartb.ie/) of [Bartificer Creations](https://bartificer.net/) and Allison Sheridan of the [NosillaCast Podcast](https://podfeet.com). The idea is to sneak up on real programming in small easy steps, using the allure of the web as the carrot to entice people forward.

Each instalment consists an article written by Bart, and an accompanying episode of Allison's [Chit Chat Across the Pond](https://www.podfeet.com/blog/category/ccatp/) podcast where Bart and Allison cover the same material in a conversational form. Allison's role is to play the proverbial _everyman_ and pepper Bart with questions to help clarify the material.

The series is intended to be ever-green, but if you play along in real-time you can join the community in the [NosillaCast Slack](https://podfeet.com/slack). The challenges set in the series are definitely more fun in real-time.
