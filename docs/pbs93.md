# PBS 93 of X â€” Encapsulation with JavaScript Objects

Since [instalment 84](https://bartificer.net/pbs84) we've been slowly making our way through all the different proverbial *hats* JavaScript objects wear. We started by reminding ourselves how JavaScript uses [objects as hashtables/dictionaries](https://bartificer.net/pbs84), then we looked at how [JavaScript uses objects to implement arrays](https://bartificer.net/pbs85). In [instalment 86](https://bartificer.net/pbs86) we looked at how [JavaScript functions are actually objects](https://bartificer.net/pbs86), and in [instalment 87](https://bartificer.net/pbs87) we we learned about Iterators, a new type of object added to JavaScript in ES6, and Generators, a related new type of function. In [Instalment 88](https://bartificer.net/pbs88) we reminded ourselves of how our browsers use objects to represent the structure of web pages using the DOM, and how jQuery objects give us a more developer-friendly way of interacting with the DOM. Next we learned about how [JavaScript provides wrapper-objects for the native types](https://bartificer.net/pbs90) (Boolean, String & Number), and finally, we learned about how [JavaScript uses objects to implement Regular Expressions](https://bartificer.net/pbs91).

This leaves just one proverbial *hat* to explore â€” JavaScript's rather unique use of objects to support object oriented programming. Because this is both an important and a somewhat complex topic, we're going to split it into two parts. In this instalment we'll focus on a core principle that forms the foundation of object oriented programming â€” *encapsulation*.

## The Problem Encapsulation Solves

At its most fundamental level, programming is about representing information and transforming it. The various types of variables allow us to store information, and functions allow us to transform or process that information.

In a simplistic script you might only be dealing with a single collection of related variables and functions that together represent a single concept. IT doesn't take long until that ceases to be true though. You very quickly find that your web apps have to represent multiple concepts, so you end with a handful of variables and functions that handle one concept, then another handful of variables and functions that deal with something else. The individual variables and functions that deal with any single concept are not related in any way. Looking at your code you just see a mix of variables and functions, and it gets very confusing very quickly. Sure, diligently following naming schemes and commenting your code can help add some order to the chaos, but surely, there must be a better way?

## The Concept of Encapsulation

[Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) is one of those core concepts of computer science that span languages. If a language supports object orientation, then it must implement encapsulation in some way.

All encapsulation must allow related variables and functions to be combined into a single entity that can represent both information, and the functions for processing or transforming that information.

Many programming languages go a step further, and include access control in their implementation of encapsulation. The idea being that some information can be labeled as purely internal or private, and that no functions outside the encapsulation can access such information.

Dictionaries are commonly used for encapsulation, especially in languages where functions, or references to functions, can be stored as the values within dictionaries.

## Encapsulation in JavaScript

Because JavaScript functions are objects, and hence, references to them can be stored in variables, we can implement basic encapsulation in JavaScript using objects with their dictionary hat on.

We can **store both information and references to functions as key/values pairs within JavaScript objects**.

Note that I described JavaScript's implementation of encapsulation as *basic* in this section's opening sentence. There's a good reason for that â€” **JavaScript's implementation of encapsulation does not provide any form of access control**. We won't encounter an implementation of that concept until we move on to PHP in future instalments.

<aside>
JavaSript's lack of support for encapsulation access control is one of the reasons C++ and Java programmers tend to look down on JavaScript and often refer to it pejoratively as a *toy language* or *just a scripting language*. When you come from a world where you can use keywords like `private` and `protected` to block access to internal variables, the idea that any script using your code can reach in and mess with any of your variables behind you back is horrifying â€” how can you write robust code if the developers using your API can tinker with all your variables behind your back?

Since Java was my first language, and hence, my introduction to encapsulation and object orientation focused heavily on access control, I too looked down my nose at JavaScript for a long time. I'm well and truly over my dumb prejudice now, but it took years, so I empathise with those who haven't yet seen the light ðŸ˜‰

## A Simplistic Worked Example â€” The Hoonyaker

<aside>When recording reviews for the [NosillaCast](https://www.podfeet.com/blog/category/nosillacast/) listener Kaylee likes to use a currency the invented and named the Hoonyaker that just happens to be worth about one US dollar.</aside>

To understand encapsulation we'll start with a completely un-encapsulated collection of a data and related functions. We'll then encapsulate just the data, and finally, the data and the functions.

### The Un-encapsulated Hoonyaker

Our starting point will be a collection of variables that describe the fictitious Hoonyaker currency and a collection of functions for interacting with this fictitious currency.

You'll find the code for this naive representation of the Hoonyaker in `hoonyaker1.js`. You can interact with these variables and functions by opening `pbs93a.html` in your favourite browser and using the JavaScript console. The examples below are intended to be executed there. Note that the page defines two global variables which contain reference to jQuery objects representing the two output areas on the page, `$OUT_TEXT` & `$OUT_HTML`, and that we'll use these variables to display the output form the various functions.

So, let's look at our starting point:

```js
//
// Define the data related to the Hoonyaker
//

const hoonyakerName = 'Hoonyaker';
const hoonyakerDescriptionHTML = 'a fictitious currency invented by podcast listener and <em>Nosillacastaway</em> Kaylee that happens to equal about one US Dollar';
const hoonyakerSymbol = 'â‚ª'; // think 'n' for NosillaCast (ignore that it's a Shekel)
const hoonyakerSymbolHTML = '<i class="fas fa-shekel-sign mx-1" title="â‚ª" aria-hidden></i><span class="sr-only">â‚ª</span>';
const hoonyakerNumDecimalPlaces = 3;

//
// Define the functions related to the Hoonyaker
//

/**
 * Generate a plain-text description of the Hoonyaker.
 * 
 * @return {string}
 */
function describeHoonyaker(){
	// use jQuery to convert HTML to text
	const plainTextDesc = $(`<p>${hoonyakerDescriptionHTML}</p>`).text();
	return `The ${hoonyakerName} is ${plainTextDesc}. It's symbol is ${hoonyakerSymbol}, and it has ${hoonyakerNumDecimalPlaces} decimal places.`;
}

/**
 * Generate an HTML description of the Hoonyaker.
 * 
 * @return {string}
 */
function describeHoonyakerHTML(){
	return `<p>The ${hoonyakerName} is ${hoonyakerDescriptionHTML}. It's symbol is ${hoonyakerSymbolHTML}, and it has ${hoonyakerNumDecimalPlaces} decimal places.</p>`
}

/**
 * Render an amount in Hoonyakers as plain text.
 * 
 * @param {number} amount
 * @return {string}
 */
function asHoonyakers(amount){
	// format the number
	const formattedAmount = numeral(amount).format('0,0[.]000');
	return `${hoonyakerSymbol}${formattedAmount}`;
}

/**
 * Render an amount in Hoonyakers as HTML.
 * 
 * @param {number} amount
 * @return {string}
 */
function asHoonyakersHTML(amount){
	// format the number
	const formattedAmount = numeral(amount).format('0,0[.]000');
	return `${hoonyakerSymbolHTML}${formattedAmount}`;
}
```

As you can see, the code simply defines a few variables and functions. We can see these functions in action like so:

```js
// output the descriptions
$OUT_TEXT.append(describeHoonyaker());
$OUT_HTML.append(describeHoonyakerHTML());

// output some formatted amounts
$OUT_TEXT.empty().append(asHoonyakers(Math.PI));
$OUT_HTML.empty().append(asHoonyakersHTML(Math.PI));
```
