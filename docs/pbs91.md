# PBS 91 of X â€” JavaScript RE Objects

Over the past few instalments we've been looking at many of the different *hats* objects wear in JavaScript. We've seen how JavaScript uses Objects to implement dictionaries/hash tables, arrays, strings, functions of various kinds, and to wrap primitive values when they need object-like behaviour. In this instalment we'll be looking at our penultimate *hat* â€” regular expressions.

As a gentle reminder, Regular Expressions, also known as RegExps or simply REs are a means of representing text patterns. 

We'll start by reminding ourselves of the syntax for regular expression literals in JavaScript. Next we'll look at some of the useful functions provided by the built-in RegExp class, and how they allow us to do two extremely common RE-related tasks â€” checking whether or not strings match a given pattern, and using patterns to break strings into meaningful components, or *string parsing* if you prefer fancier jargon ðŸ™‚. After that we'll take a quick look at how the String and Array built-in classes make use of REs, and will finish with a nice new RE feature being added in ES2018 TO CHECK

## Regular Expressions on JavaScript

Regular expressions are an abstract theoretical computer science concept, and many different languages have been devised to express them. JavaScript uses one of the most common RE languages â€” *Perl Compatible Regular Expressions*, or PCRE.

Different programming languages choose to implement REs in very different ways. Some languages have just minimal support for REs, storing them simply as strings. Others integrate them deeply, providing native representations and implementations. While JavaScript doesn't integrate REs quite as deeply as Perl does, it does have extremely good RE support, including RE literals and a built-in class (`RegExp`) for storing RE objects.

We covered REs in detail in instalments XXXXXX TO DO, but let's quickly go over the highlights again, starting with RE literals.

## Regular Expression Literals

Throughout this series within a series looking at all the different hats JavaScript makes objects wear we've already seen many of the types of literal JavaScript supports. We've see object literals, array literals, function literals, and string literals:

```js
// an object literal representing a simple dictionary
const contactDetails = {
	twiter: '@ltpod',
	web: 'http://www.bartb.ie/',
	gitHub: 'https://github.com/bartificer'
};

// an array literal
const mucusSynonyms = ['bogies', 'boogers', 'snot'];

// a function literal
const insulter = function(){
	window.alert('Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries!');
};

// a string literal
const bothedMovieLine = 'lying, dog-faced pony soldier';
```

In JavaScript, RE literals consist of PCRE patters enclosed by forward slashes (`/`) followed by zero or more flags. As a simple example, here's an RE literal to match all occurrences of `cat` or `dog` in any case: 

```js
const schemeRE = /cat|dog/gi;
```

The RE itself is `cat|dog`, which you'd read as *'cat or dog'*, and `g` & `i` are flags â€” `g` for *global*, and `i` for *case insensitive*.

## RE Syntax Lightning Refresher

I'm not going to repeat the entire syntax here, instead, I'll recommend two very good links on Mozilla's excellent developer portal:

1. [Regular Expressions Guide â€” developer.mozilla.org/â€¦](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
2. [Regular Expressions Cheatsheet â€” developer.mozilla.org/â€¦](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Cheatsheet)

But, let's run through a few highlights all the same.

### Escaping Special Characters

Firstly, special characters are escaped with a backslash character (`\`).

### Flags

Secondly, while there are a total of six possible flags (as of ES2018), there are three particularly important ones:

| flag | Meaning |
| :--: | --- |
| `g` | Perform a **global** search. This flag alters the behaviour or many functions that use regular expressions, the details will be in the documentation for the function in question. |
| `i` | Perform as **case-insensitive** search. |
| `m` | Perform a multi-line search, i.e. interpret `^` as *start of line* instead of *start of string*, and `$` as *end of line* instead of *end of string*. | 

### Character Classes

PCRE provides us with many codes for specifying a single occurrence of a given special character, or a single individual character from a related group of characters.  The table below is far from an exhaustive list, but it covers the ones you're most likely to need regularly.

| Character Descriptor | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- |
| `.` | Any one character. |
| `\d` | Any digit. |
| `\w` | Any word character (a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, and underscore). |
| `\s` | any blank space character |
| `\D` | any character that's not a digit |
| `\W` | any non-word character |
| `\S` | any non-space character |
| `\t` | a tab character |
| `\n` | a newline character |

As well as supporting many pre-defined character classes, PCRE also lets us define our own by listing the contents of our desired class within square brackets. For example, the character class to match any single un-accented lower-case western vowel is `[aeiou]`.

PCRE also allows us to specify ranges of characters within our character classes, so the following character class represents a single lower-case hexadecimal digit â€” `[0-9a-f]`.

Finally, we can negate our entire character class by starting it with the carat symbol (`^`), so, any one character that's not a lower-case western vowel can be matched with `[^aeiou]`.

### Position Indicators

PCRE also gives us a number of position indicators to help us anchor our pattern within a string. Again, the table below is not exhaustive.

| Position Indicator | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- |
| `^` | the start of the string (or of a line with the `m` flag). |
| `$` | the end of the string (or of a line with the `m` flag). |
| `\b` | a word boundary (start or end of a word). |

### Quantity Specifiers

As well as allowing us to specify which characters we want where, PCRE also allows us to specify how often parts of the pattern should repeat. Again, not an exhaustive list, but some of the common PCRE quantity specifiers are shown in the table below.

| Quantity Specifier | Meaning | Example |
| :---: | :--- | : -- |
| `|` | or | `/cat|dog/` *cat or dog*
| `?` | zero or one of â€¦ | `/https?/` *http optionally followed by an s* |
| `*` | zero or more of â€¦ | `/a*/` *any number of a characters, including none* |
| `+` | one or more of â€¦ | `/a+/` *one or more a characters* | 
| `{n}` | exactly `n` of â€¦ | `/b{2}/` *two b characters* |
| `{x, y}` | between `x` and `y` (inclusive) of â€¦ | `/\d{1,3}/` *one, two, or three digits* |

### Groupings (Capturing & Non-Capturing)

Plain parenthesis serve a dual role in PCRE. They allow you to group parts of a pattern together so they can be addressed as a group by the various operators and quantity specifiers, but they also act as so-called *capture groups*. Each opening parenthesis starts a numbered sub-pattern, and some of the regular expression-related functions allow us to make use of these numbered sub-patterns. The sub-patterns are numbered from the left, and patterns can be nested within each other.

As an example, given the following RE: `/((\d{2}):(\d{2}))(:(\d{2}))?/`, the strings `12:01` and `12:01:02` would both match. The final set of parenthesis group the `:\d{2}` together so the `?` makes that entire piece of the pattern optional.

If we take the second of those two strings (`12:01:02`) and match it against the regular expression then the parentheses also mean that there will be five numbered sub-patterns, or capture groups, populated. Starting form the left the first open parenthesis is part of a set that encloses `(\d{2}):(\d{2})`, so the first numbered match will be `12:01`. The second opening parenthesis only encloses `\d{2}`, so it will match just `12`. Similarly the third opening parenthesis will match `01`. The fourth opening parenthesis encapsulates `:(\d{2})`, so it will match `:02`. Finally, the fifth opening parenthesis encapsulates just `\d{2}`, so it will match `02`.

Of those five example capture groups four capture useful information â€” 1 captures the time without seconds, 2 captures the hours, 3 the minutes, and 5 the seconds, but 4 captures nothing of value, it's only there to connect the third colon to the seconds and make them optional as a group, not individually. We need this grouping to make the RE work, but we don't want to capture it!

Non-capturing groups allow us to group parts of an RE together without them being captured. A non-capturing groups starts with `(?:` and ends with `)`. So, we can re-write our sample RE to only capture the four useful groupings like so: `/((\d{2}):(\d{2}))(?::(\d{2}))?/`.

## The RegExp Class

JavaScript represents regular expressions with the built-in class `RegExp`.  For full documentation of all properties and functions [see the class's page on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp).

We're going to confine our look at this class to just two functions â€” those that encapsulate the two most common use-cases for regular expressions â€” validation, and parsing.

While there is a `RegExp` constructor available for use, you're better off using RE literals to create `RegExp` objects. Why? Because the contractor takes a string as an argument, so the backslash character needs to be double-escaped, one for the string, then again for the RE. This is very confusing to look at!

To prove this point, the following two assignments result in `RegExp` objects representing the same pattern:

```js
const hasWebScheme1 = /^https?:\/\//i;
const hasWebScheme2 = new RegExp('^https?:\\/\\/', 'i');
```

Note that `RegExp` instance functions can be directly invoked on RE literals, even when they have flags:

```js
const doesMatch1 = /^\d+$/.test(42); // true
const doesMatch2 = /^https?:\/\//i.test('HttP://www.podfeet.com/'); // true
```

### Validation with `.test()`

The first common task regular expressions are used for is to validate input of some kind to be sure it meets some required pattern.

When validating data all you're interested in is a yes/no answers, you're not interested in capturing sub-patterns or anything like that. The `RegExp` class provides and instance function dedicated to this use â€” `.test()`. It takes the string to test as an argument, and returns `true` if the string matches the pattern, and `false` otherwise.

For one-off tests it makes sense to use the `.test()` function on an RE literal:

```
const valToTest = 42;
const isOK = /^\d+$/.test(valToTest);
console.log(`testing '${valToTest}' resulted in ${isOK}`);
```

When making multiple tests it's more efficient to create an RE object once, then re-use that object as needed:

```js
const okRE = /^\d+$/;
const valsToTest = [42, 'boogers', '99'];
for(const val of valsToTest){
	const isOK = okRE.test(val);
	console.log(`testing '${val}' resulted in ${isOK}`);
}
```

### Parsing and Extracting with `.exec()`

Parsing is a little more involved than testing, and this is where *capture groups* come into their own. By parsing we mean processing text in order to extract meaningful information. 

For example, we can use a regular expression with three capture groups to break a time apart into its component pieces:

```js
const timeParseRE = /^(\d{2}):(\d{2}):(\d{2})$/;
```

Given this RE, we can use the `.exec()` instance function from the `RegExp` class to parse a given string. This function takes the string to parse as an argument, and has many possible return values depending on both the RE flags and whether or not the string matched the RE.

Let's start by assuming the RE does does not have the global (`g`) flag set (as is the case with our example). In this scenario `.exec()` will return one of two things â€” if the RE does not match it will return `null`, and if it does match it will return an array. Assuming a match, the first element in the array (i.e. the *zeroth* element) will be the full matched string. This will be followed by the matched values for each capture group in the RE, so, the first capture group will be at position 1, the second at position 2, etc..

Given our example RE above we can see this in action:

```js
console.log(timeParseRE.exec('boogers')); // null
console.log(timeParseRE.exec('12:01:02')); // ["12:01:02", "12", "01", "02"]
```

In the real world we would extract the parts into sensibly named variables, probably using restructuring assignment:

```js
const [, hrs, mins, secs] = timeParseRE.exec('12:01:02');
console.log(`hrs=${hrs}, mins=${mins} & secs=${secs}`);
```

Notice the leading comma to discard the un-wanted first item in the array.

so far we have been breaking a single time into pieces, what if we wanted to find all times in a long string of text? This is where the global flag comes into play.

If the RE that `.exec()` is called on has the global (`g`) flag set then the RE object becomes *stateful* and remembers the location in a string immediately following the previous match. If you pass the same string in again the search will resume from where it left off. This will keep happening until there are no more matches, at which point `null` will be returned, and the internal state gets reset.

This behaviour is extremely un-obvious and clunky, and there are proposals to fix it in a future version of the language, but for now, it's the best we can do. If we update our previous RE to remove the start and end of string indicators we can look over a string of text and pull out all the times:

```js
// define a string to search
const stringToSearch = "I thought we might meet at 07:00, but that was too early for Bob so I suggested 10:00, but that was too late for Alice, so we settled on 08:00 in meeting room 3.";

// define a global RE
const globalTimeRE = /(\d{2}):(\d{2})(?::(\d{2}))?/g;

// loop over the string using .exec() on the RE
let match = null;
while(match = globalTimeRE.exec(stringToSearch)){
	const [, hr, min, sec] = match;
	console.log(`Found time with hours='${hr}', minutes='${min}', and seconds='${sec}'`);
}
```

## String Functions that use REs

A number of the instance functions provided by the built-in `String` class make use of regular expressions. As per usual I don't want to give a definitive list of all string functions that use REs, but I do want to highlight what I consider the most notable ones.

Firstly, there is `.search()` which is essentially the mirror image of the `.test()` instance function provided by the `RegExp` class, but with one very important difference. While you call `.test()` on an RE object and pass it a string, you call `.search()` on a string object and pass it an RE.

While calling `.test()` on an RE returns a boolean, calling `.search()` on a string doesn't. Rather than returning a boolean `.search()` returns an integer â€” the character index within the string where the sub-string that matched the passed RE starts, or -1 if no match was found.

```js
const meetStr = "meet Bob at 10:00 tomorrow";
const timeIdx = meetStr.search(/\d{2}:\d{2}/);
if(timeIdx >= 0){
	console.log(`the time starts at index ${timeIdx} of the string '${meetStr}'`);
}else{
	console.log('no time found');
}
```

Unless you need the index, it's easier to use the `.test()` function provided by `RegExp`.
