# PBS 94 of X â€” Better JavaScript Class Attributes

This is the third instalment of our step-by-step introduction to Object Oriented (OO) programming, and OO in JavaScript in particular. We started by looking at the foundation upon which OO is built â€” encapsulation. Encapsulation allows us to combine all the data and functions related to a concept of thing into a single object.  In the previous instalment we looked at how we can uses classes to construct arbitrarily many similar objects. In effect, a class represents a concept of thing in the abstract, and each object constructed by that class is a representation of a concrete example of the concept or things. Specifically, we created a class to represent imaginary currencies, and we used it to built instances of that class to represent the Ferengi Bar of Gold-pressed Latinum and the Quatloo from Star Trek. We focused almost entirely on the most important function within any class â€” the constructor.

We ended the previous instalment by demonstrating how our current, simple, implementation of data attributes allows users of our classes to by-pass all the data validation we added to our constructors. In this instalment we'll address that using a very powerful JavaScript feature â€” *getters and setters*.

## The Problem to be Solved

The final implementation of the `ImaginaryCurrency` class from the previous instalment (`ImaginaryCurrency4.js`) implements a best-practices constructor that supports multiple signatures, optional arguments with default values, argument coercion when possible, and error handling when invalid values are specified. As we demonstrated in the previous instalment, this constructor is both flexible and robust.

We can demonstrate the flexibility using the JavaScript console in the file `pbs94d.html` from the previous instalment:

```js
// call the constructor without any arguments
const genericImaginaryCurrency = new ImaginaryCurrency();
$OUT_HTML.append(genericImaginaryCurrency.describeHTML());

// call the constructor specifying only 2 most common attributes
const monopolyDollar = new ImaginaryCurrency(
    'Monopoly Dollar',
    'the currency from the board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monopoly</a>'
);
$OUT_HTML.append(monopolyDollar.describeHTML());

// call the constructor specifying some attributes
const buck = new ImaginaryCurrency({
    name: 'Buck',
    descriptionHTML: 'the US Dollar really',
    symbolHTML: 'ðŸ’µ'
});
$OUT_HTML.append(buck.describeHTML());

// call the constructor specifying all values
const iou = new ImaginaryCurrency({
    name: 'IOU',
    descriptionHTML: 'money borrowed with every good intention to replay it in the vague future',
    symbol: 'ðŸ’¸',
    symbolHTML: '<i class="fas fa-comment-dollar mx-1" title="$" aria-hidden></i><span class="sr-only">$</span></i>',
    numDecimalPlaces: 1
});
$OUT_HTML.append(iou.describeHTML());
```

We can also demonstrate the constructor's robustness:

```js
// numbers are coerced when posible
const bitcoin = new ImaginaryCurrency({
    name: 'Bitcoin',
    descriptionHTML: 'the leading crypto-currency',
    symbol: 'BTC',
    symbolHTML: '<i class="fab fa-bitcoin mx-1" title="BTC" aria-hidden></i><span class="sr-only">BTC</span></i>',
    numDecimalPlaces: "8" // string not number
});
$OUT_HTML.append(bitcoin.describeHTML());
const mathGeekDollar = new ImaginaryCurrency({
    name: 'Math Geek Dollar',
    descriptionHTML: 'the US Dollar as used by math geeks',
    numDecimalPlaces: Math.PI // decimal number not integer
});
$OUT_HTML.append(mathGeekDollar.describeHTML());

// errors are thrown when un-coerceably-invalid values are passed
const imaginaryDollar = new ImaginaryCurrency({
	numDecimalPlaces: 'âˆš-1'
});
// throws TypeError since 'âˆš-1' is a string that doesn't parseInt()
// message: 'if passed, details.numDecimalPlaces must be an integer greater than or equal to one'
const negativeDollar = new ImaginaryCurrency({
	numDecimalPlaces: -2
});
// throws RangeError since -2 is a number, but not valid
// message: 'details.numDecimalPlaces cannot be less than zero'
```

Clearly, the constructor is doing a good job of protecting the integrity of the data attributes it adds into the instance objects it constructs.

However, if we access the attributes directly, this version of the class produces instances that are powerless to protect themselves from invalid changes to attribute values:

```js
const evilDollar = new ImaginaryCurrency('Evil Dollar');
evilDollar.numDecimalPlaces = 'ðŸ˜ˆ'; // invalid value!!!
$OUT_HTML.append(evilDollar.describeHTML());
$OUT_HTML.append(`PI as evil dollars is ${evilDollar.asHTML(Math.PI)}`);
```

The constructor would never have let us set the number of decimal places to an emoji, but we could easily bypass that protection by simply setting the number of decimal places after the constructor has finished creating the instance. As things stand we can protect the initial values of our attributes, but they're defenceless after that. **We need to give our attributes perpetual protection from invalid values!**

## *Getters & Setters* â€” Functions in Disguise!

The concept of *getters & setters* is not unique to JavaScript, but it's also far from ubiquitous. Some languages have them, but many (including PHP) don't.

Both getters and setters are functions masquerading as data attributes. From the point of view of the programmer writing the class a getter is a function that returns as value and takes no arguments, and a setter is a function that takes exactly one argument, and does not return a value. Meanwhile, from the point of view of a programmer using a class with getters and setters, they behave as data attributes with super-powers.

Without knowing it, we have been interacting with getters and setters when using built-in classes. As an example, we think of `Math.PI` as a data attribute because we simply use it like any other variable. We don't treat `Math.PI` like a function, if we did, we would write `Math.PI()`, we treat it like a variable that someone else happened to define on our behalf and add to the global scope. If we wanted to simulate the behaviour we would do something like:

```js
var NaiveMath = { PI: Math.PI };
console.log(`Naive Ï€ is ${NaiveMath.PI} and real Ï€ is ${Math.PI}`);
```

Unsurprisingly, this will log:

 ```
 Naive Ï€ is 3.141592653589793 and real Ï€ is 3.141592653589793
 ```

Now let's try to be evil ðŸ˜ˆ

```js
NaiveMath.PI = 4;
Math.PI = 4;
```

Neither of the above lines will throw an error, so you would assume both have had the same effect, so let's test that assumption:

```
console.log(`Naive Ï€ is ${NaiveMath.PI} and real Ï€ is ${Math.PI}`);
```

You would probably expect this to log:

```
Naive Ï€ is 4 and real Ï€ is 4
```

But that's not what happens! What actually gets logged is:

```
Naive Ï€ is 4 and real Ï€ is 3.141592653589793
```

The data attribute `Math.PI` has a superpower â€” it appears to be immutable. How is that possible? If you were to peek under the hood what you would find is that Math.PI is actually a function not a data attribute, but it's being disguised using a JavaScript *getter*!

We'll look at the getter and setter syntax in detail in a moment, but for now, let's quickly prove that `Math.PI` is not magical because it's part of a built-in object, it's just using a standard language feature that we're free to use in our code too. Here's a `SmartMath` object written using a getter which behaves just like the native `Math` object:

```js
const SmartMath = {
    get PI(){ return Math.PI; }
};
console.log(`Smart Ï€ is ${SmartMath.PI} and real Ï€ is ${Math.PI}`);
```

As you probably expect, this logs:

```
Smart Ï€ is 3.141592653589793 and real Ï€ is 3.141592653589793
```

Now let's try be evil agian:

```js
SmartMath.PI = 4;
Math.PI = 4;
```

Again, no errors thrown, so, have we actually altered a fundamental constant of the universe? Nope!

```js
console.log(`Smart Ï€ is ${SmartMath.PI} and real Ï€ is ${Math.PI}`);
```

Even after we apparently changed both `PI` attributes to four, the above still logs:

```
Smart Ï€ is 3.141592653589793 and real Ï€ is 3.141592653589793
```

We've produced what appears to be a data attribute with super-powers!

### Getters & Setters are Can be Used in Any Encapsulated Object

JavaScript getters and setters pre-date ES6, and hence, pre-date the `class` keyword. They can be used within any encapsulated object.

However, in this instalment we've only going to look at their use in class definitions.

## Robust JavaScript Class Attributes with Getters and Setters

Getters and setters have all kinds of uses in JavaScript, but we're going to use them first and foremost to protect our classes' data attributes.

When I first introduced the concept of encapsulation I mentioned that in some languages encapsulation provides access control to data attributes, but that JavaScript is not one of those languages. Protection of attributes is what we're trying to achieve, but the language does support that, so we have to make do with an approximation which combines the power of getters and setters with a commonly accepted convention.

### Though Shalt Pretend Underscores Bestow Invisibility!

Since JavaScript does not support actual access control to data attributes or instance functions, a near-universally accepted convention has emerged â€” the authors of JavaScript classes name attributes and functions not intended for direct access by users of their classes with names pre-fixed with the underscore character. They also omit all such attributes and functions from their API documentation. This means that unless you read the source of third party libraries, you'll never know that they contain a whole bunch of *private* attributes and functions who's names all start with underscores.

**If you want JavaScript classes written by others to behave reliably when you use them, never ever access any attribute or call any instance function with a name starting with an underscore.**

Conversely, **when writing your own classes, always mark data attributes and instance functions that you want others to avoid directly accessing or calling by naming them with a leading underscore**.

### Creating Attributes with Getters & Setters

To add a single attribute with the potential to develop superpowers to a class you need three things:

1. A *'private'* data attribute to store the sanitised value.
2. A *getter* to publish the value of the attribute.
3. A *setter* to intelligently update the value of the attribute.

Let's demonstrate the concept with a very simple class, one to represent a circle. You'll find a version of the code for this class with comments in the file `Circle1.js`, but I've included it below without comments to help show the structure.

```js
class Circle{
    constructor(radius=1){
        const radiusNumber = parseFloat(radius);
        if(isNaN(radiusNumber)){
            throw new TypeError('radius must be a number greater than or equal to zero');
        }
        if(radiusNumber < 0){
            throw new RangeError('radius cannot be negative');
        }
        this._radius = radiusNumber;
    }
    
    get radius(){
        return this._radius;
    }
    
    set radius(radius){
        this._radius = radius;
    }
}
```

Notice that the syntax for the getter is just like that of an instance function that takes no arguments, but pre-fixed with the keyword `get`. Similarly, the syntax for the setter is like that for an instance function that takes one argument, but pre-fixed with the keyword `set`.

To users of the class, the `radius` attribute behaves like any other data attribute:

```
const circle1 = new Circle(5);
console.log(`radius=${circle1.radius}`);
circle1.radius = 3;
console.log(`radius=${circle1.radius}`);

// output:
// -------
// radius=5
// radius=3
```

Note that this attribute has not developed any superpowers yet:

```
const circle2 = new Circle();
console.log(`radius=${circle2.radius}`);
circle2.radius = 'ðŸ˜ˆ';
console.log(`radius=${circle2.radius}`);
// output:
// -------
// radius=1
// radius=ðŸ˜ˆ
```

Let's add the needed super powers by simply moving the data validation code from the constructor to the setter. You'll find the code for this updated version of the class in the file `Circle2.js`:

```js
class Circle{
    constructor(radius=1){
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    
    get radius(){
        return this._radius;
    }
    
    set radius(radius){
        const radiusNumber = parseFloat(radius);
        if(isNaN(radiusNumber)){
            throw new TypeError('radius must be a number greater than or equal to zero');
        }
        if(radiusNumber < 0){
            throw new RangeError('radius cannot be negative');
        }
        this._radius = radiusNumber;
    }
}
```

Notice that the entire body of the original constructor has been moved to the setter, and the entire constructor has been replaced by a simple call to the setter.

This simple re-structuring of the code has made the class much more robust, and ensures that the identical data validation code is always applied to the radius, regardless of whether it was passed as an argument to the constructor or set later.

We can now see that our attribute has gained the desired superpowers:

```
const myCircle = new Circle();
console.log(`radius=${myCircle.radius}`);
myCircle.radius = 'ðŸ˜ˆ'; // throws an error!
```

## Derived Data Attributes with Getters & Setters

It's not unusual for a class to need to represent two pieces of data that are directly related to each other. Circles have a radius and a diameter, and one is always twice the other. You could leave it to users of your class to know the relationship, and, to add the maths to do the conversion into their code, but that doesn't seem very user-friendly. You could also add a function to calculate and return the diameter, and even one to set the radius based on a diameter. You could achieve that end by adding the following instance function to the `Circle` class:

```js
diameter(d){
  // if no args were passed, return the current diameter
  if(arguments.length === 0) return 2 * this.radius;
  
  // otherwise set the radius to half the diameter
  this.radius = d/2;
}
```

This would work, but users of your class would need to remember that `radius` is a data attribute, but `diameter()` is an instance function. Your users would need to write code something like this:

```js
const myCircle = new Circle();
myCircle.radius = 5;
console.log(`radius=${myCircle.radius} & diameter=${myCircle.diameter()}`);
myCircle.diameter(6);
console.log(`radius=${myCircle.radius} & diameter=${myCircle.diameter()}`);
```

Notice that the code has to threat the radius like it's a data attribute, i.e. `myCircle.radius` to get the value, and `myCircle.radius = newValue` to set the value. But, the code has to treat the diameter as a two-signature function. To get the current diameter we have to use `myCircle.diameter()`, and to set it, myCircle.diameter(newValue).

What we have here is an opportunity or getters and setters to shine!

```js
set diameter(diameter){
  const diameterNumber = parseFloat(diameter);
  if(isNaN(diameterNumber)){
    throw new TypeError('diameter must be a number greater than or equal to zero');
  }
  if(diameterNumber < 0){
    throw new RangeError('diameter cannot be negative');
  }
  if(diameterNumber === 0){
    this._radius = 0; // avoid divide-by-zero error
  }else{
    this._radius = diameterNumber / 2;
  }
}
```

We can do something similar for the other derived properties of a circle like the circumference and the area. You'll find all three derived attributes implemented with getters and setters in `circle3.js`, and you can interact with these attributes using the JavaScript console on `pbs95c.html`:

```js
const c1 = new Circle();
c1.diameter = 4;
console.log(`a circle with a diameter of 4 has a radius of ${c1.radius}, a circumference of ${c1.circumference}, and an area of ${c1.area}`);

const c2 = new Circle();
c2.circumference = 4;
console.log(`a circle with a circumference of 4 has a radius of ${c2.radius}, a diameter of ${c2.diameter}, and an area of ${c2.area}`);

const c3 = new Circle();
c3.area = 4;
console.log(`a circle with an area of 4 has a radius of ${c3.radius}, a diameter of ${c3.diameter}, and a circumference of ${c3.circumference}`);
```

## Read-Only Data Attributes with Getters & Setters â€” Be Assertive or Tell White Lies?

We'll end this instalment by circling back to where we started, and taking another look at read-only data attributes.

The file `circle4.js` contains an updated version of our `Circle` class that has two read-only attributes added, one representing the value of Ï€ the object will use in its calculations, and one containing a credit for the class author. The getters and setters have all been updated to use this local value for Ï€ rather than `Math.PI`.

For the credit I chose to take the same approach Math.PI does, and silently ignore assignments to the read-only attribute. This is done by providing a getter, but no matching setter:

```js
get classAuthor(){
  return 'Bart Busschots of Bartificer Creations at https://bartificer.net/';
}
```

 We can interact with this updated version of the class using the JavaScript console on the file `pbs95d.html`:
 
 ```js
 const c1 = new Circle();
 console.log(`The Circle class is by ${c1.classAuthor}`);
 c1.classAuthor = 'pesky plagerist';
 console.log(`The Circle class is by ${c1.classAuthor}`);
 ```
 
 I refer to this approach as being a kind of programming *white lie*. Why a lie? Because an assignment operator was executed and it neither assigned a value, nor, threw an error.  The assignment operator is supposed to assign, but it didn't, and it was silent about that fact â€” that's dishonest! I call it a *white lie* because in an example like this, it really doesn't matter that the assignment was silently ignored.
 
If the attempted assignment is consequential, is it still OK to silently ignore the assignment attempt? I would argue that it's not, because it could easily to to confusion by those using your class, and, it can lead to some extremely frustrating and difficult to track down bugs â€” what developer assumes that an operator as fundamental as the assignment operator could silently fail to do it's one and only job?

The implementation of the read-only PI property illustrates a more assertive alternative approach, don't omit the setter, define one that always throws an error:

```js
get Ï€(){
  return 3.1415;
}
	
set Ï€(pi){
  throw new Error('Ï€ is a read-only attribute');
}
```

Note that JavaScript is fully UTF-8 aware, so you can use symbols (and even emoji) in variable names!

Now let's see what happens when we try change the value of Ï€:

```js
const c2 = new Circle();
c2.Ï€ = 3.14; // throws an error!
```

As you'll see, the attempt to change Ï€ throws an error.

My advice would be that attempts to change consequential read-only attributes should result in an error being thrown, but it's acceptable to silently ignore changes to inconsequential read-only attributes.
